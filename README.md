# Hangman game!


### About the Game

This project is my version of the hangman game!
A game that is used in kindergarten help
in the cognitive development of children.

I developed this game putting together everything I learned and studied in the first two
weeks of the Web Dev Bootcamp at Ironhack.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
### And how does the game work?
The object of the game is for you to guess the word hidden by "dashes".

For each wrong letter a part of the Iron Man (our character on the gallows) pops up. You have up to 6 chances of error before hanging our hero.

As if with just a few letters you know the hidden word you can guess the word and see if it's correct!
